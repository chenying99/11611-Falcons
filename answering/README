Falcon answering system
-----------------------

Authors: Avnish Saraf (avnishs@andrew.cmu.edu), Pankesh Bamotra (pbamotra@andrew.cmu.edu)

To run a production like testing case, run the following: -
    ./answer ../data/set2/a7.txt ../data/sample_question_data_set2_a7

To turn off the verbosity on cmdline: -
    Set VERBOSITY = logging.INFO in Commons.py


Possible issue you may face: -
1. Library missing issue. Please run the following: -
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    python -m spacy.en.download         <- Takes about 5 minutes to download

2. On a windows system, please change the shebang path in `answer' to correct python binary.

If any issue persists, please let the authors know.
